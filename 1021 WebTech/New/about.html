            <h2 class="question">How much does a membership cost, and how long does it last for?</h2>
            <p class="answer"><b>A membership to RockSoc costs £5</b>, regardless of whether you're a student of the 
                University of Leeds, and it lasts the entire academic year.</p>
        </li>

        <li class="row">
            <h2 class="question">What happens in RockSoc Friday socials?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Friday is our night out! We usually head to the Dry Dock pub at <b>around 8pm</b> to let 
                our members socialise before heading out to <a href="https://www.thekeyclubleeds.com/">The Key Club</a>
                 for as long as you're willing to stay!</p>
        </li>

        <li class="row">
            <h2 class="question">What other benefits do I get with my membership?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Our Treasurer crunched the numbers to get a deal with the Dry Dock pub to sell cocktails 
                to members off the bar for <b>only £3!</b> Additionally, you get a cheaper entry to The Key Club on 
                Fridays, costing £4. Just show your card to them and they'll be happy to accept it.</p>

            <h2 class="question">I've bought a membership, how do I get my card and member status online?</h2>
            <p class="answer">Speak to our treasurer about getting a card, and they'll be able to provide you with one.
                 Speak with the <a href="committee.html">President</a> on Discord and they'll validate your membership
